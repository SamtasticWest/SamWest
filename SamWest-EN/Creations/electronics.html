                    <h1>Electronic Creations</h1>
                    <p>
                        With over ten years of experience in electronics, both personally and professionally, I have ventured into creating and manufacturing various electronic solutions. My expertise includes assembling complex systems, programming circuits, and designing innovative devices tailored to different needs.
                    </p>
                    <h2>Computers and Systems</h2>
                    <p>
                        My interest in computers began when I was under 10 years old, and since then, I have built computers for myself, businesses, and others. Building computers has always been a passion of mine, and it has allowed me to gain extensive experience in assembling, customizing, and optimizing computer systems. I have worked on various projects, from workstations for professionals to setups for home users.

                    <h2>School Projects</h2>
                    <p>
                        Here are two projects completed during my university studies that demonstrate my expertise in electronics and manufacturing.
                    </p>
                    <h3>GRBL-based CNC Machine</h3>
                    <p>
                        This project was my final project in college, where I built a CNC machine using the GRBL controller. This project allowed me to develop in-depth skills in programming, mechatronics, and automated systems fabrication.

                    </div>

                    <h3>Illuminated Medicinal Wheel</h3>
                    <p>
                        During my university studies, I created an illuminated medicinal wheel for one of my courses. This project combined my interest in electronics and cultural traditions. I designed and built this wheel using LEDs and a custom circuit to provide dynamic and meaningful lighting.

                    <h2>Illuminated Comic Covers</h2>
                    <p>
                        One of my recent creations includes illuminated comic covers. I made these covers using both transparent and opaque plastics to create captivating light effects. These covers add a modern touch to classic pieces, integrating electronic elements for an interactive experience.

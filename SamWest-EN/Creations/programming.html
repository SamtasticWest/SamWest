                    <h1>My Passion for Programming</h1>
                    <p>
                        I started programming in university, where I learned the basics of various languages and tools. Since then, my passion has only grown, and I've had the opportunity to work on various projects. I feel comfortable with several programming languages, including Java, C#, C++, Python, and Arduino. These tools have allowed me to create projects ranging from simple games to technical applications.

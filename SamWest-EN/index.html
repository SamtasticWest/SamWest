                    <p>
                        My name is Sam West, and I hold a college diploma in electronics from Collège Boréal. I then studied at Laurentian University where I earned my Bachelor's degree in English Literature with a minor in Computer Science. I later obtained my B.Ed. in Intermediate/Senior education from Laurentian University with a focus on English teaching.

                    <p>
                        I have always had a passion for technology and teaching. Throughout my career, I have worked in various environments, ranging from over five thousand feet underground to classroom teaching.

		    <h1>How I Got Into Making Things</h1>
			<article>
           
               <p>I've always been very interested in figuring out how things worked and from a young age I was taking apart computers as well as other electronics (sometimes to my parent's dismay as I would accidentally break them.). This ultimatly paid off as I became very comfortable around electronics which lead me down that path in college and it was there that I was introduced to the world of CNC machinery as well as 3D printers(Which I would clump into the same category as CNC machines but some people like to split hairs on that.). From there I would go on to buying my instructor's 3D printer, this machine would interest me so much that I would go on to building my own custom CNC wood engraver as my final project before graduating from college.<br><br>Although this began as a very hobbiest level of playing around with these machines I did find myself overtime growing more comfortable with them as I taught myself how to 3D model my own designs as well as further understanding G-Code. While doing this I found myself wanting to explore more into the world of CNC engraving and more specifically laser engraving. Ultimatly that dream became a reality as I bought my own 40W laser engraver.<br><br>Over the years I've used a combination of my CNC and 3D printing equipment as well as knowlege to not only create things for myself but as I also created products I've sold to people around the world. On top of that I've also created practical aplications for my own work place. </p>

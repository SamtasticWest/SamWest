               <h3>Video Games</h3>
               <p>To say that video games have played a large part in my life might be a understatement. I've been playing a variety of different games since my dad introduced games like WarCraft and Creatures to me on floppy disks. As someone who's first language was French and only went to French school video games actually ended up playing a roll in teaching me to read English and I still credit WarCraft 3 for teaching me to read. Some may enjoy reading to unwind after a long day but a good game always does the trick for me.</p>

          
               <h3>Retro Game Collecting</h3>
               <p>I've often found myself fond of a lot of older games, whether it be out of admiration for what they achived technologically, our of pure nostaliga or both and a lot of these games serve as a sort of comfort food in a way. I began collecting retro games while working at Staples in college where I met a lady who was trying to dispose of her son's old NES and from there my collection has only grown to include a multitude of other consoles as well as games.</p>
	
                <h3>Table Top Games</h3>
                <p>As a kid I always really enjoyed making up stories and little did I know I would still be doing that into my 20s as I host games like Dungeons and Dragons for my friends. Personally I find these game nights to be some of the best times I've had because unlike in other games where there are preset rules when it comes to table top games the only thing that really limits what can happen is someone's own creativity. </p>
                
                <h3>Baking/Cooking</h3>
                <p>I got very into both baking and cooking during the pandemic. I found it to be an incredibly fun way to pass the time with a great reward at the end(This may have contributed to the weight I gained during this time.) <a href="../food/food.html">Click Here if you want to see some photos of things I've made.</a>&nbsp;</p>
                
                <h3>Electronic Related Proplem Solving</h3>
                <p>I know this sounds like one of those humble brags where someone goes "Oh my biggest flaw is that I just work too hard" but I do genuinely love working with electronics, give me a phone, laptop or anything that doesn't work and I am very much so in a happy place spending the day troubleshooting different parts and attempting to make repairs. Having a friend or family member ask if there is a way to create circuit, code or or device that can preform a task is a sure fire way to keep me busy for several weekends.</p>

			<h1>Outdoor Activities</h1>
			<article>

				<h3>Walking/Hiking</h3>
				<p>One of my favourite ways to both start and cap off a day is with a nice walk. Although I'll walk practically anywhere around town I've often been more of a fan of going off onto trails in order to get away from the noise that comes from being around busy streets. I'm quite fortunate to find myself in Sudbury where we're walking distance from an abundance of different trails around our many lakes.</p>

				<h3>Jogging</h3>
				<p>As a former lineman in football cardio was never one of my main prorities when it came to working out and although it has been years since I've played football I carried those excersize habbits for far too long at the gym. However in August of 2021 I took it upon myself to change that and I began jogging every morning Mon-Fri and although I still prefer a relaxing walk through the trails I've found a fondness for starting my mornings off with a nice run ranging anywhere from 5km to 21.5km depending on my mood that morning and the weather.</p>
				<p>

				</p>
				<h3>Hanging out by the lake</h3>
				<p>Whether it be swimming, tubing, kneeboarding, or going for boat rides I've always enjoyed being around and in the water, and as someone who prefers the cold it is especially handy to go for a dip on particularly warm summer days.</p>
				<p>
				</p>
				
				<h3>Skiing</h3>
				<p>I've been downhill skiing for the majority of my life now and it is by far one of my all time favourite activites during the winter. Although I would like to say that I am a snowboarder as well I'm much more comfortable on a pair of skiis and far far less likely to wind up on my face when skiing.</p>
